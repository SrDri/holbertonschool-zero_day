# Collaboration: be up to date

Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and it’s better for you to be up to date with their changes.

For this task, and only for this task, please update your file README.md in the master branch from Github.com. It’s the only time you are allowed to update and commit from Github interface.

When it’s done, in your terminal:

get locally all changes of the master branch (your README.md file will be updated) write in a file up_to_date (at the root of your repository) the git command line used add this new file up_to_date, commit (message: “How to be up to date in git”) and push to the origin
